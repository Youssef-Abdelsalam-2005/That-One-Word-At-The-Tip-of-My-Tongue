# That One Word At The Tip of My Tongue
This app is for when you're trying to remember that one word and it's like it's right there but you can't spit it out.

The frontend is React and the backend is in Node.

Keep in mind, the server is hosted on Render with the free tier so if the api hasn't had activity in 15 minutes, it is shut down, it usually takes about a minute to come back up.
